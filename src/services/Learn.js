    story: `How the SAVE student loan plan works
Instead of paying 10% of their discretionary income a month toward their undergraduate student debt under the previous Revised Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan, or REPAYE, plan, borrowers will eventually be required to pay just 5% of their discretionary income under the SAVE plan.

Those who make less than $15 an hour won’t need to make any payments under the new option, the Education Department says.

“The SAVE plan is very generous to borrowers, almost like a grant after the fact,” said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.`,

    story: `As a result, many already struggling to recover from the pandemic and hit by the strikes will now have to come up with a massive lump sum in rent that may be beyond their reach.

“My hope is that the impending August 1 rent debt repayment deadline actually push us to reshape and transform our current system into one that proactively supports vulnerable tenants to stay housed, not just at this moment but over the long term,” Los Angeles Councilperson Nithya Raman (District 4) said in a statement.

Tenants have until Aug. 1 to pay any missing rent that was due between March 2020 to September 2021. For rent due between October 2021 to Jan. 31, tenants have until February 2024 to pay the missing rent.

The mayor’s office and the Los Angeles Housing Department have launched a campaign to inform vulnerable tenants about the resources and protections available to them.`,
